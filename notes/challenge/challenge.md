## Todo

1. Create two buttons components called ButtonExplore and ButtonLetsGo. You will need to create a folder, jsx and scss file for each of the buttons.

2. When you have created the files you will need to write the JSX and style the components.

- ButtonLetsGo should have a background color the same as the `$color-secondary;` variable from our \_variables.scss file.
- ButtonExplore should have a border the same color as our `$color-primary;` variable from our \_variables.scss file.

3. You need to Import your buttons and render them in App.jsx. Can you get them side by side? Flexbox? Grid?

4. **EXTENSION** Can you hide them for devices over 992px?
